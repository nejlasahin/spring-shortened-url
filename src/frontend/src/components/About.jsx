                <h3 className="mt-5">Benefits of a Short URL</h3>
                <p>How many people can even remember a long web address, especially if it has tons of characters and
                    symbols? A short URL can make your link more memorable. Not only does it allow people to easily
                    recall and share your link with others, it can also dramatically improve traffic to your
                    content.</p>
                <p>On a more practical side, a short URL is also easier to incorporate into your collateral – whether
                    you’re looking to engage with your customers offline or online.</p>
                <p>Shortened Url App is the best URL shortener for everyone, from influencers to small brands to large
                    enterprises, who are looking for a simple way to create, track and manage their links.</p>
